            <h2 class="big-title">" It is a massive gap for people to read the political paper, so most of the voters don't understand what the candidate did, or what they will do for voters. "</h2>
            <p>To find out what and when would affect the voter decision, and what's the key factors that they don't count on the paper to make their decision, we decide to figure out the voter's decision flow.</p>
            <div class="gap"></div>
            
            <h2>As-Is Scenario Map: What is the voter's journey ?</h2>

                <li>Voter feel that the Paper is too thick and hard to read, then it result in making bad decision.</li>
                <li>Some voters focus on some specific issues, but these issues cannot  reveal on and be classified by the Paper.</li>
                <li>Some voters needs more information about the candidates, but it cannot be concluded on the Paper.</li>

            <h2>Define the Information Architecture</h2>
            <p class="case-txt">After analyzing all the pain points and the voter's journey, we conclude the idea and have an Information Architecture of this new platform for the voter.</p>
